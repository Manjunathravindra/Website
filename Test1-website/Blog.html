        In the first part of this series, I asked the question “What is a computer?” It <br>seems like a simple question with a simple answer. I am typing this on a <br>computer; it has a screen and a keyboard, and inside are the CPU, the RAM, <br>a hard drive and some other fancy electronics.
        <br>
        <br>
        As H.L. Mencken would no doubt have said, this answer is neat, plausible,<br>and also wrong. Understanding the more complex truth reveals the most <br>fundamental theory in Computer Science.

           &nbsp; Machines do one thing. A sewing <br>&nbsp;machine stitches together fabrics of <br>&nbsp;various kinds, but can’t launch satellites <br> &nbsp;into geo-synchronous orbit.<br>&nbsp;On the other hand, a Falcon 9 would do a terrible <br>job of Picot Edging.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;Computers are different. They can <br>&nbsp;perform a breathtaking range of tasks. <br>&nbsp;The same machine that allows me to <br>&nbsp;video conference with my friends on <br>&nbsp;the other side of the world can also <br>&nbsp;calculate my taxes, play a mean game of Angry Birds <br>and compose music.

            <h2>&nbsp;Universal machines</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;Computers are a special type of <br>&nbsp;machine called a universal machine. <br>&nbsp;They can run programs that do almost anything. The same computer can be <br><br><figcaption>A Falcon 9 rocket, abjectly failing to sew a<br>decorative doily.

What a universal<br> &nbsp;machine does is determined by the instructions the machine is given, not<br> &nbsp;by the machine itself.</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;When a computer runs a program, it stops being a universal machine that <br>&nbsp;can do any task and turns into a specific machine that performs the task <br>&nbsp;defined by the program. The program itself is a machine in the traditional <br>&nbsp;sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;One of the specific types of machine that can be defined using a program is<br> &nbsp;a universal machine. So I can create a program that itself runs programs. <br>&nbsp;Most importantly, a universal machine that is defined purely by a program <br>&nbsp;can ran exactly the same programs as a hardware computer.

            <h2>&nbsp;Alan turing</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;All this was discovered by Alan Turing. He was the brilliant British code <br>&nbsp;breaker and scientist who formulated the Church-Turing Thesis.<br>&nbsp;While the mathematics behind the thesis is formidable, the basic idea is fairly easy to <br>&nbsp;understand.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;Turing demonstrated three important conclusions:</p>
            <ui>
                <li>There is a small but important class of problems that can never be solved <br>by a program — these are called the non-computable tasks, everything <br>else is a computable task.</li>
                <li>
                    Any machine that can run certain basic operations can be programmed <br> to perform any computable task. These basic operations are loops, logic <br>and variables. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Running a universal machine is a computable task. 
                </li>
            
            </ui>
            <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of Turing’s work is he published it in <br>1936, almost a decade before the first computer system was built.</p>

            <h2>What does this all mean?</h2>
            <p>
                Computers are a special class of machine that can be programmed to do <br>almost anything, in particular the can be programmed to run a universal <br>machine. From a program’s perspective, running on a programmed <br>universal machine is exactly the same as running on a physical one.
            </p>
            <p>All of modern computing is built on this idea.</p>
            <p>
                For example, when you use your web browser, you are actually running <br>dozens of different software computers, each layered on the one below.<br> The browser is a computer, which is probably built in the C++ programming<br> language, which uses an operating system, which runs in a virtual machine,<br> which runs another operating system, which is built in another <br>programming language, which translates code down to an assembly<br> language, which runs on the instruction set of your hardware; and there are <br>more layers in between these. Each of these layers is a universal machine: a <br>computer.
